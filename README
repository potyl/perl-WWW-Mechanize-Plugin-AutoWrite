WWW-Mechanize-Plugin-AutoWrite
==============================

This module provides a plugin for WWW::Mechanize that automatically saves the
contents of the last page accessed. The module can also save the whole HTTP
session by saving the pages as well as the HTTP headers from the request and the
response.

This plugin is simply activated by loading it and by instruction the
WWW::Mechanize where to store the files. Then the mechanize pages will be saved
automatically as they are fetched. This is true for any kind of HTTP request:
get, post, etc.

See the file "Changes" for all changes made to this software.
